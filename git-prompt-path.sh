# # git-prompt-path
#
# Display git information next to every path component in your prompt.
#
# Example output:
#
#     ~/src/project(master+2)/foo*/bar/baz+%/submodule(release-1.2=)%/fizz/buzz
#
# Note how the branch names of both the project and the submodule are
# visible, and how the state of the index and worktree is visible at every
# directory.
#
# The status symbols are the same as used by `__git_ps1` from [`git-prompt.sh`][1]:
#
#  - `+` Changes in index.
#  - `*` Changes in working tree.
#  - `%` Untracked files.
#
# ## Usage examples
#
# First source both [`git-prompt.sh`][1] from git/contrib,
# and `git-prompt-path.sh` from this repository:
#
#     source ~/.../git-prompt.sh
#     source ~/.../git-prompt-path.sh
#
# And then for `zsh`:
#
#     PROMPT='$(git_prompt_path)$ '
#
#
# Or for `bash`:
#
#     function update_ps1 { PS1="$(git_prompt_path)\$ " }
#     PROMPT_COMMAND=update_ps1
#
#
# These will use the default colours. To use it without colour, call
# `git_prompt_path` with a format string without colour codes:
#   `$(git_prompt_path "%s%s")`
#
# Alternatively, to use your own colours, put them in the format string:
#   `$(git_prompt_path "...%s...%s...")...`
# Make sure to surround the colour codes with the right escape sequences for
# your shell. (`[` and `\]` for bash, `%{` and `%}` for zsh. Note that the `%`s need to
# be escaped inside the format string with another `%`.)

# Usage: git_prompt_path [$format [$path]]
# Print a path with git information next to each component of the path.
#
# Each component of $path will be printed along with some git status information
# according to the printf format string $format.
#
# The format string can contain two positional parameters: the path component,
# and the git information (in that order).
#
# __git_ps1 is must be defined when this function is invoked.
